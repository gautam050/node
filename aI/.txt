1) What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI is the ability of machines or software to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
Examples: learning, decision-making, understanding language, recognizing images, etc.

2) What are Large Language Models (LLMs)? How do they work?
LLMs are computer models trained on huge amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language. 
They work by:
- Breaking text into tokens
- Learning patterns from large datasets
- Predicting the next word/token in a sequence
This allows them to answer questions, generate text, summarize, translate, etc.

3) Difference between Traditional AI and Generative AI:
Traditional AI:
- Rule-based or task-specific
- Follows fixed logic designed by humans

Generative AI:
- Creates new content (text, images, audio, code)
- Learns from data and generates outputs like ChatGPT or image models

4) What is “prompting” in LLMs? Why is it important?
Prompting means giving clear instructions or questions to the model so it knows what output you want.  
It is important because the quality of the prompt directly affects the quality of the answer.

5) Role of “tokens” in a language model:
Tokens are small pieces of text (words or subwords).  
Models read and generate text token-by-token.  
More tokens = longer input/output, more cost, more processing.

6) Limitations/Risks of Generative AI:
- May give incorrect or made-up answers (hallucinations)
- Can reflect bias from training data
- No real-time knowledge
- Can be misused to create fake or harmful content
- Cannot fully understand emotions or real-world context
